<h1>Clash of Clans API Project</h1>
<h4>By Dax Amburgy</h4>


<p>While changing the settings in Clash of Clans to remove screen shake while attacking other bases, I discovered that the settings held an API key. I wanted to write a program to see what all
I could do with this API Key.</p>

<p>In order to get this project working you will need to go to the clash of clans API webpage and get your own API key. Then pip install the dotenv library to create a .env file that the python 
script can use to externally grab the key for your clone of this project.</p>

<p>What this can do is get a complete data pulldown of all of your base and clan stats and output it into a .json file. This data could potentially be converted to excel but that will be for a future
update if I decide to work on this project again.</p>
